## 📝 Employee Onboarding System

### Project Overview

The **Employee Onboarding System** is a multi-step form application designed to streamline the process of collecting and managing new employee information. The system ensures data accuracy, dynamic validations, and provides a smooth user experience for HR departments and new hires.

Key features include:

- Multi-step form with 5 steps: **Personal Info, Job Details, Skills & Preferences, Emergency Contact, Review & Submit**.
- Conditional logic and dynamic validation based on user input.
- Cross-step rules (e.g., manager list filtered by department, skill selection based on department, guardian info for users under 21).
- Auto-saving of form state in React state.
- Real-time validation using Zod and React Hook Form.
- Interactive UI using **shadcn/ui** components and **Tailwind CSS** styling.

### Technologies Used

- **React** – Frontend framework for building interactive UI.
- **TypeScript** – Strongly typed JavaScript for better maintainability and fewer runtime errors.
- **React Hook Form** – For form state management and validation integration.
- **Zod** – Schema-based validation for forms, including conditional and cross-field validations.
- **Tailwind CSS** – Utility-first CSS framework for fast and responsive UI design.
- **shadcn/ui** – Pre-built React UI components for consistent design.
- **Redux Toolkit** – Centralized state management for form data across steps. -**Redux Persist** – Persist form state across page reloads and browser sessions.
- **react-hot-toast** – Notification system for success/error messages.

### How It Works

1. **Step 1 – Personal Info**: Collects full name, email, phone, DOB, and optional profile picture.
2. **Step 2 – Job Details**: Captures department, position, start date, job type, salary, and manager selection.
3. **Step 3 – Skills & Preferences**: Users select primary skills, provide experience, set working hours, remote work preference, and optionally request manager approval if remote >50%.
4. **Step 4 – Emergency Contact**: Captures contact info, and if age <21, requests guardian details.
5. **Step 5 – Review & Submit**: Displays all entered information in read-only format and requires confirmation before submission.

### Additional Features

- Conditional rendering and dynamic form fields based on previous inputs.
- Step progress indicator with visual feedback for completed and active steps.
- Error handling with friendly messages.
- Auto-reset and validation to prevent submitting incomplete or invalid data.
